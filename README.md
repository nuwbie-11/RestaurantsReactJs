## Used Library

### Font Awesome
- in this app i used `fontawesome` to provide icons

- Install extras for brands like github. And to doing it you can do `npm install --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`

- Shows Restaurants
- Filter by Open Status, Price and Categories
- Because Price and Status are not built in on API, i built or generate custom status/price. Thus, Every page reload, those custom are re-generated
